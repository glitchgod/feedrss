info="This program is souly designed with no warranty or anything of the kind when you use this program.\nAt this time you are using version 2.x.x and is FREE to use and free to download from github.\n--------------------*****************------------------\nThe whole point of this program is to take multiple video based RSS feeds and add premade and custom filters to them, and by doing so allowing you to be able to set what does and doesn’t get grabbed to be processed! This in no ways replaces torrent engines but instead allows for some additional options that most engines do not support or require additional modifications to do. This program is designed to be low ram and have a low footprint for all functions that it uses.\n--------------------*****************------------------\nOn the home screen on the left is the details about when the next scheduled data pull is, issues that arose from the last one, time it was update, TOTAL unfiltered tors found, and processed tors (doesn’t mean downloaded). On the right side is the schedule modifier at the top with the single – taking away a minute, the – taking away 10minutes, the + adding 1 minute, and the ++ adding on 10 minutes. NOTE: Setting the time lower than the current set timer will not speed up the timer.\n--------------------*****************------------------\nAt the bottom is the info button that brings you to this page, the history button that will allow you to inspect the last grab and previous ones, the computer button leads you to setting up the save location, and the normally invisible button beside that will appear when there is an update. \n--------------------*****************------------------\nClicking on the pencil next to the “Website List -- >” will take you to a page that allows you to set up, edit, and see the status of the website sources that you provide. On this page you will be notified if there is an issue with the website in the response of error codes such as error404. \n--------------------*****************------------------\nClicking on the “Filter Settings -- >” pencil will take you to the main section of what makes this so special. In their you will find settings that are easy to under stand along with a section that will allow for custom words, symbols, or characters. \nFor advance setup please refer to the github page where it explains how to do an advance setup."
